# billiards-match-visualizer

This project is a computer vision-based tool that takes a YouTube video of a billiards (9-ball) match and visualizes ball movements, shots, and table activity in real-time. It serves as the first step toward a full match analysis system using machine learning.

This project was inspired by [PerformStars](https://performstars.com/), which demonstrates advanced ball tracking and shot prediction for cue sports. This project is an independent, academic-style implementation and does not use or reproduce any proprietary assets, data, or models from PerformStars.
